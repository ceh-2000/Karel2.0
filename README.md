In order provide more middle school girls with the opportunity to learn how to code, the researcher will combine Android and Raspberry Pi coding to make a cellphone-controlled robot. The app that controls the robot will consist of multiple levels, and by traversing these levels the user will learn about basic computing principles including loops, if-then statements, and recursion. Connectivity will be achieved over WiFi using a Raspberry Pi. This project will overcome the basic obstacle of beginner coding by making the intangible tangible.
